## the diffrence between yolov5 and shai algorithms is 
Slicing Aided Hyper Inference:Object detection and instance segmentation are by far the most important applications in Computer Vision. However, the detection of small objects and inference on large images still need to be improved in practical usage. Here comes the SAHI to help developers overcome these real-world problems with many vision utilities.
